# Welcome!
This repository is filled with a collection of projects I had the opportunity to work on during my time in completing the [Data Scientist and Machine Learning Certifications in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-python) at DataCamp. Each project explores a unique topic and showcases a variety of skills: From essential basics of NumPy and Pandas, to supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, these projects have helped me grow my skills to becoming a confident data scientist.

Every project is written as a **Jupyter Notebook**. In order to render these notebooks, we can use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/), a simple way to share Jupyter Notebooks.
