# Welcome! :wave:
This repository is filled with a collection of projects I had the opportunity to work on during my time in completing the [Data Scientist and Machine Learning Certifications in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-python) at DataCamp. Each project explores a unique topic and showcases a variety of skills: From essential basics of NumPy and Pandas, to supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, these projects have helped me grow my skills to becoming a confident data scientist.

Every project is written as a **Jupyter Notebook**. In order to render these notebooks, we can use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/), a simple way to share Jupyter Notebooks.

## To View Projects :eyes:
Sometimes, GitHub can render the static HTML file into a lovely Jupyter notebook, but if that isn't the case, you can try the following:

1. Please head to this [link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/OmeRazaKhan/DataCamp-DS-Track/tree/main/), which connects *nbviewer* with my GitHub account!
2. Select a project, in this case, a *directory*, you want to explore!
3. Click on the file ending in **.ipynb**, to open a *Jupyter Notebook* in **Python**

That's it! Enjoy exploring my repository and I hope you learn a thing or two!
